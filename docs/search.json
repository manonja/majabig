I am just interested in learning how deep learning can solve tangible problems, and how teams and people can make ethical decisions based on data.\nToday I am giving back to the community, so we are going to make an image classification model that classifies bears, using fastai, HuggingFace Spaces and Gradio. It’s so inspiring for me to see that in a few lines of code I was able to have something sharable! (You can see it here!)"

So I decided to start one anyways to document my learning journey with deep learning and AI.\nI am learning the fundamentals, and on day two of the fastai course from Jeremy Howard I was able to train my first model to classify bears.\nHOW COOL IS THAT???\nStay curious, Manon"
