Welcome! 

In today's world I hear a lot that blogs are dead. 

Maybe.

But I love blogs! So I decided to start one anyways to document my learning journey with deep learning and AI. 

I am learning the fundamentals, and on day two of the fastai course from Jeremy Howard I was able to train my first model to classify bears. 

HOW COOL IS THAT??? 

Stay curious, 
Manon
